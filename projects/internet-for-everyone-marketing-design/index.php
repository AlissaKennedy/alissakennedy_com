        <figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Project Loon Logo Design</strong> - Project Loon is Google's brain child to deliver the Internet to the whole globe with balloon power. The logo uses Google's brand colors for cohesion. Balloons circumnavigate the earth along a dotted line trajectory. The balloon in the foreground joins the “I” of “Project” to the the graphic to the project name. The decorative font is friendly like handwriting, meanwhile, having straight vertical lines that also convey order and precision.

          <figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Project Loon Full Page Magazine Ad with Marketing Writing</strong> - This ad explains the emergent technology with a large page title and content writing. I combined a real photo of a Project Loon balloon with a watercolor painted sky to merge imagination and technology with a welcoming feeling. Visual balance is achieved by inverting the dark sky section with an opposite contrasting white section on the bottom with a similar amount of visual weight. I added the project logo and company information. Note: Designed before Google’s logo redesign.

          <figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Google Loon Poster Design</strong> - This poster emphasizes the project name and purpose. The starry background depicts the balloons flying high above the globe at the edge of space, while transmitting signal to each other in an ever-expanding communication network. The hint of yellow at the Earth’s horizon conveys a new horizon in the technological accomplishment.
